/**
 * Authentication listeners are responsible for handling AllJoyn authentication
 * requests.
 *
 * Listener objects are the Java objects that handle notification events and are
 * called from AllJoyn in the context of one of its threads.  All listener
 * objects are expected to be multithread safe (MT-Safe) between construction
 * and destruction.
 *
 * This rule extends to other objects accessed during processing of
 * notifications.  For example, it is a programming error to allow a notifiation
 * method to update a collection in another object without serializing access
 * to the collection.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that as soon as one sets up a
 * listener object to receive notifications from AllJoyn, one is implicitly
 * dealing with multithreaded code.
 *
 * Since listener objects generally run in the context of the AllJoyn thread
 * which manages reception of events, If a blocking AllJoyn call is made in
 * the context of a notification, the necessary and sufficient conditions for
 * deadlock are established.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that when one receives a
 * notification from AllJoyn, that notification is executing in the context of
 * an AllJoyn thread.  If one makes a blocking call back into AllJoyn on that
 * thread, a deadlock cycle is likely, and if this happens your bus attachment
 * receive thread will deadlock (with itself).  The deadlock is typically broken
 * after a bus timeout eventually happens.
