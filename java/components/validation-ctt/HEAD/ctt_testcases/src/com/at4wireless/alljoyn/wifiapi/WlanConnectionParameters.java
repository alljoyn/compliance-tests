	 * 															exists. Do not use this flag if the destination network is an infrastructure network.
	 * 		WLAN_CONNECTION_IGNORE_PRIVACY_BIT	0x00000004		Ignore the privacy bit when connecting to the network. Ignoring the privacy bit has the
	 * 															effect of ignoring whether packets are encrypted and ignoring the method of encryption
	 * 															used. Only use this flag when connecting to an infrastructure network using a temporary
	 * 															profile.
	 * 		WLAN_CONNECTION_EAPOL_PASSTHROUGH	0x00000008		Exempt EAPOL traffic from encryption and decryption. This flag is used when an
	 * 															application must send EAPOL traffic over an infrastructure network that uses Open 
	 * 															authentication and WEP encryption. This flag must not be used to connect to networks
	 * 															that require 802.1X authentication. This flag is only valid when wlanConnectionMode is
	 * 															set to wlan_connection_mode_temporary_profile. Avoid using this flag whenever
	 * 															possible.

	 * Windows XP with SP3 and Wireless LAN API for Windows XP with SP2: This member must be set to 0.
