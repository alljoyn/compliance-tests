     * 
     * 				Windows XP with SP3 and Wireless LAN API for Windows XP with SP2:  Per-user profiles are not supported. Set this parameter to NULL.

     * 					WLAN_PROFILE_GET_PLAINTEXT_KEY		On input, this flag indicates that the caller wants to retrieve the plain text key from a wireless 
     * 														profile. If the calling thread has the required permissions, the WlanGetProfile function returns 
     * 														the plain text key in the keyMaterial element of the profile returned in the buffer pointed to by 
     * 														the pstrProfileXml parameter.
     * 
     * 														For the WlanGetProfile call to return the plain text key, the wlan_secure_get_plaintext_key 
     * 														permissions from the WLAN_SECURABLE_OBJECT enumerated type must be set on the calling thread. The 
     * 														DACL must also contain an ACE that grants WLAN_READ_ACCESS permission to the access token of the 
     * 														calling thread. By default, the permissions for retrieving the plain text key is allowed only to the
     * 														members of the Administrators group on a local machine.
     * 
     * 														If the calling thread lacks the required permissions, the WlanGetProfile function returns the 
     * 														encrypted key in the keyMaterial element of the profile returned in the buffer pointed to by the 
     * 														pstrProfileXml parameter. No error is returned if the calling thread lacks the required permissions.
     * 
     * 														Windows 7: This flag passed on input is an extension to native wireless APIs added on Windows 7 and 
     * 														later. The pdwFlags parameter is an __inout_opt parameter on Windows 7 and later.
     * 					WLAN_PROFILE_GROUP_POLICY			On output when the WlanGetProfile call is successful, this flag indicates that this profile was 
     * 														created by group policy. A group policy profile is read-only. Neither the content nor the preference 
     * 														order of the profile can be changed.
     * 					WLAN_PROFILE_USER					On output when the WlanGetProfile call is successful, this flag indicates that the profile is a user
     * 														profile for the specific user in whose context the calling thread resides. If not set, this profile 
     * 														is an all-user profile.
     * @param pdwGrantedAccess
     * 				The access mask of the all-user profile
     * 					WLAN_READ_ACCESS		The user can view the contents of the profile.
     * 					WLAN_EXECUTE_ACCESS		The user has read access, and the user can also connect to and disconnect from a network using the profile. If
     * 											a user has WLAN_EXECUTE_ACCESS, then the user also has WLAN_READ_ACCESS.
     * 					WLAN_WRITE_ACCESS		The user has execute access and the user can also modify the content of the profile or delete the profile. If a
     * 											user has WLAN_WRITE_ACCESS, then the user also has WLAN_EXECUTE_ACCESS and WLAN_READ_ACCESS.
     * 
     * @return		If the function succeeds, the return value is ERROR_SUCCESS.
     * 				If the function fails, the return value may be one of the following return codes.
     * 					ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED			The caller does not have sufficient permissions. This error is returned if the pstrProfileXml parameter
     * 												specifies an all-user profile, but the caller does not have read access on the profile.
     * 					ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE		A handle is invalid. This error is returned if the handle specified in the hClientHandle parameter was not
     * 												found in the handle table.
     * 					ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER		A parameter is incorrect. This error is returned if any of the following conditions occur:
     * 													- hClientHandle is NULL.
     * 													- pInterfaceGuid is NULL.
     * 													- pstrProfileXml is NULL.
     * 													- pReserved is not NULL.

     * 												allocate memory for the profile.
