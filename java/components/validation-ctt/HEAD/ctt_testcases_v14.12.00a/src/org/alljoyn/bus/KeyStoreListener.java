/**
 * Implemented by a user-defined class that is responsible for loading and
 * storing keys.  Encryption and decryption of key data is handled internally
 * using the password supplied by {@code getPassword}.
 *
 * Listener objects are the Java objects that handle notification events and are
 * called from AllJoyn in the context of one of its threads.  All listener
 * objects are expected to be multithread safe (MT-Safe) between construction
 * and destruction.
 *
 * This rule extends to other objects accessed during processing of
 * notifications.  For example, it is a programming error to allow a notifiation
 * method to access a collection in another object without serializing access
 * to the collection.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that as soon as one sets up a
 * listener object to receive notifications from AllJoyn, one is implicitly
 * dealing with multithreaded code.
 *
 * Since listener objects generally run in the context of the AllJoyn thread
 * which manages reception of events, If a blocking AllJoyn call is made in
 * the context of a notification, the necessary and sufficient conditions for
 * deadlock are established.
 *
 * The important consideration in this case is that when one receives a
 * notification from AllJoyn, that notification is executing in the context of
 * an AllJoyn thread.  If one makes a blocking call back into AllJoyn on that
 * thread, a deadlock cycle is likely, and if this happens your bus attachment
 * receive thread will deadlock (with itself).  The deadlock is typically broken
 * after a bus timeout eventually happens.
 *
 * Note well that calls into the KeyStoreListener will be happening in the
 * context of an AllJoyn endpoint receive thread, and therefore long-lived
 * operations will block that endpoint for the duration of the call.  Don't
 * dawdle in your implementations of these functions.

     * the listener.  Since there are two threads and one Object involved,
     * one must consider multi-thread safety.

     *   they are final, the client can simply return a reference to the

     *   code to be using them, the client can simply return a reference to the

     * - If the keys are dynamic and could change while AllJoyn is using them,
